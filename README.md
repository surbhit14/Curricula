**Project Name: Curricula**

About Curricula:
Curricula is a platform for students who want to get rewarded for their extra-curricular activities and companies who want to get publicity through the means of students
Companies can sponsor students with good skills in any activity like dance,music,art or some sort of sport like football,cricket,etc
 Any company can register on Curricula and sponsor some students by providing them with celo tokens and the 
 students in turn can use the celo tokens to buy some goodies from their respective sponsors.
 
 The sponsored students could represent the companies at various state level and national level competitions where various other students would come to know
 about the sponsored company
